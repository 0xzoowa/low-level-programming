# Question 250



What is unspecified behavior and how is it different from undefined behavior?


# Answer



While undefined behavior means the standard does not enforce any behavior at
all, unspecified behavior means that it enforces a set of possible behaviors.
In other words, the compiler has a choice from a fixed set  of behaviors
to occur.
