# Question 267



Why do some SSE instructions require the memory operands to be aligned?


# Answer



Most of the time, aligned accesses are much faster. So there are generic forms
of SSE instructions like `movups` -- "Move Unaligned Packed Single-Precision Floating-Point
Values" and the usual forms like `movps`, which require aligned memory operands.
